Comparison between a vector autoregression model (VAR) consisting of factors and drivers, 
and a model vector error correction (VECM). The comparison is made by simulating the time series for 
each model and then analyzing its efficiency in predicting each factor. 

The data folder contain sample of factors series (level, slope and curvature) of Nelson and Siegel of the American Swap Spread Curve and some financial variables that drive them. The sample period spans from 2009-11-11 until 2015-10-23. 

The Principal_Simulation.py script is the executable that takes the methods from the Auxiliary.py script.
